I bought Raspberry Pi 4B last year and the overall experience was quite good, but the price skyrocketed like financial management.

Why don't I recommend `Raspberry Pi`? 

Because Raspberry Pi, originally priced at $35, starts at 500 or even 1000 in China!

Very expensive. 

When we convert it to 35 US dollars, it is approximately 251.92 RMB. 

It can be seen that the price difference is earned by intermediaries.
